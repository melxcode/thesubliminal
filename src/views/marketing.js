          More than 4.5 billion people now use the internet, while social media
          users have passed the 3.8 billion mark. Nearly 60 percent of the
          worldâ€™s population is already online, and the latest trends suggest
          that more than half of the worldâ€™s total population will use social
          media by the middle of this year.

          Your social media platforms are one of the best ways to connect with
          your target audience. As a powerful tool for establishing genuine
          relationships with your customer base, social media gives you a direct
          pathway to have conversations, get feedback, and push new leads to
          your website. However, this is all fueled by strong content creation.
