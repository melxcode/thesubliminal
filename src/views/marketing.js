        More than 4.5 billion people now use the internet, while social media users have passed 
        the 3.8 billion mark. Nearly 60 percent of the worldâ€™s population is already online, and 
        the latest trends suggest that more than half of the worldâ€™s total population will use 
        social media by the middle of this year.

          Your social media platforms are one of the best ways to connect with your target audience.
           As a powerful tool for establishing genuine relationships with your customer base, social media 
           gives you a direct pathway to have conversations, get feedback, and push new leads to your website.
            However, this is all fueled by strong content creation.
