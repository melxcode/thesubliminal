        </Typography>

        <Typography gutterBottom>
          UX DESIGNERS: They determine the structure of the interface and the
          functionality. How it‚Äôs organized and how all the parts relate to one
          another. In short, they design how the interface works. If it works
          well and feels seamless, the user will have a good experience. But if
          navigation is complicated or unintuitive, then a lousy user experience
          is likely. UX designers work to avoid the second scenario. User
          experience is determined by how easy or difficult it is to interact
          with the user interface elements that the UI designers have created.
        </Typography>

        <Typography gutterBottom>
          UI DESIGNERS: They decide what the application is going to look like.
          They have to choose color schemes and button shapes ‚Äî the width of
          lines and the fonts used for text. UI designers create the look and
          feel of an application‚Äôs user interface. They‚Äôre concerned with
          aesthetics. It‚Äôs up to them to make sure the application‚Äôs interface
          is attractive, visually-stimulating and themed appropriately to match
          the purpose and/or personality of the app. And they need to make sure
          every single visual element feels united, both aesthetically, and in
          purpose.
